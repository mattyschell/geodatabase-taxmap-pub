## Data Management

1. What is the best way to deal with invalid geometries?  Fix in source (not currently an option) or somehow fix on the fly?  This gets into possible ETL machinations again.

## Vector Tile Index 

1. Where should the index be stored for re-use?  In the database?  A local geodatbase with the ArcGIS Pro project


## Automation 

1. In geoserver styles were stored in xml and could be version controlled, shared, and deployed.  How to meet this requirement with an ArcGIS Pro project as the styler?

2. Does an ArcGIS Pro project contain sensitive info?  Can I drop it into version control and any VM I like?

3. How does one reshare the web layer when share package won't allow a reload to the same layer?  Delete and re-share?
